# Time complexities
Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm changes with respect to the size of the input. If the input size is nn, then f(n)f(n) is a function that describes how the number of operations (or steps) the algorithm performs grows as nn increases.

## What denotes time complexity? 
If size of input is n, then f(n) is a function of n that denoted the time complexity.

f(n) represents the number of instruction executed for the input value n.
That means the running time of a algorithm depends on value of n because as the number of n is greater it takes more steps or operations for the algorithm to complete running and producing value.
