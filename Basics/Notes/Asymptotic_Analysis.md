# Asymptotic Analysis 
Asymptotic Notations are mathematical tools used to analyze the performance of algorithms by understanding how their efficiency changes as the input size grows.

How to find the time complexity?

Approach 1:
Running the operation with different input size on data structure you want to compare one by one to see how much time does particular operation takes.

Arguments for approach 1:

1. It is possible that for first input size one data structure give best performance and for other input size the second gives best performance.
2. It might be possible that in some machine for some input size of data structure, it is performing well while in other machine, the second data structure give the best performance.


### Therefore, examining the exact running time is not the best solution to calculate the time complexity.
