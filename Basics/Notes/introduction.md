# Introduction
A data structure is the organization of data in a way so that it can be used efficiently.


### Data types

important things about data types
Data types defines certain domain of values
Data types defines operations allowed on those values.

### Abstract Data types

ADTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using functions without specifying what is there inside the function and how the operations are performed.


# Types of data structure  

### Linear Data structure
A data structure is linear when all the elements are arranged in a linear (sequential) order
Examples: Arrays, stack, queue, linked list

If a element in the data structure has only one predecessor and only one successor expect the first and the last element then that is linear data structure. 

### Non-Linear Data structure
A data structure is non linear when all the elements are not arranged in a linear (sequential) order. There is no linear arrangement of the elements.

Examples : Tree, Graph

### Static data structure

In these types of data structures, the memory is allocated at compile time. Therefore, maximum size is fixed.
Examples: Arrays

Advantage : Faster access 
Disadvantage: slower insertion and deletion


### Dynamic data structure
In these type of data structure, the memory is allocated at tun time. Therefore, maximum size if flexible.
Example: Linked List

Advantage: faster insertion and deletion 
Disadvantage: slower access
